BLACKPINK is a brand new girl group, fresh to the K-pop scene. The group was created by YG Entertainment, the same company as the man who brought you Gangnam Style by Hallyu star Psy.

BLACKPINK is only the second girl group that the company has trained and put together, but they are already taking Korea (and many other countries, for that matter) by a storm. The group is comprised of four members: Lisa, Jennie, Jisoo and Rose. The group has released four singles so far, with the most viewed of which being "Boombayah," towering with over 89 million views to date —a huge number compared to other K-pop artists let alone for a rookie group.
